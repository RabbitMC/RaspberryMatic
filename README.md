The RaspberryMatic project is a collaborate effort to provide a lightweight, [Linux/buildroot](http://buildroot.org/)-based HomeMatic compatible distribution for embedded devices like the [RaspberryPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/). It is based on the **O**pen-**C**entral-**C**ontrol-**U**nit-SDK ([OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu)) provided by [eQ-3](http://eq-3.de) as part of the [HomeMatic](http://homematic.com/) home automation platform. The RaspberryMatic distribution is provided as a full microSD card image that can be directly flashed and then used in a RaspberryPi as the main operating system for controlling all kind of HomeMatic compatible devices with full compatibility to a CCU2 device directly sold by eQ-3.

## Compatible Third-Party Addons
The CCU platform allows to enhance the functionality of a CCU by installing so-called Addon packages. For RaspberryMatic, standard CCU-Addon packages won't work because included binaries have to be recompiled for the hard-float buildroot environment RaspberryMatic uses. Here is a list of well-known already compatible Addon packages (please note that this list might be incomplete):

* [CUxD](https://github.com/jens-maus/cuxd)
* [XML-API](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/XML-API)
* [hm_pdetect](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm_pdetect)
* [Email-Addon](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm_email)
* [CUxD-Highcharts](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/CUxD-Highcharts)
* [HQ-WebUI](https://github.com/jens-maus/hq-webui)
* [DB-Access](https://github.com/jens-maus/dbaccess)
* [QuickAccess](https://github.com/jens-maus/quickaccess)
* [Script-Parser](https://github.com/litti/scriptparser)
* [WebMatic](https://github.com/ldittmar81/webmatic)
* [Sonos Player](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm-sonos)
* [hm2mqtt](https://github.com/owagner/hm2mqtt)
* [CCU-Historian](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm-ccu-historian)
* [Watchdog](https://github.com/jens-maus/hm-watchdog)
* [homeputer CL Studio](http://www.contronics.de/download/homeputer-studio-software.html)
* [Print / ProgrammeDrucken](https://github.com/litti/hm-print)
* [HomeMatic Check_MK](https://github.com/alexreinert/homematic_check_mk)

## Installation
The installation of RaspberryMatic is quite straight forward as it is delivered as a full SD card image that can be directly flashed onto a microSD card and put into the corresponding RaspberryPi. As such the installation consists of the following basic steps:

1. [Download latest release](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases) archive (`RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`) for the hardware platform you are using:
   * `wget https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/releases/download/X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD/RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`
2. Unarchive zip file resulting in an SD card image (`RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img`), e.g.:
   * `unzip RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.zip`
3. Check sha256 checksum to check integrity of SD card image, e.g.:
   * `sha256sum -c RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img.sha256`
4. Based on your operating system use a Flash-tool to copy the image onto your microSD card:
   * <i>Linux</i>: `sudo dd if=RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4096`
   * <i>macOS</i>: `sudo dd if=RaspberryMatic-X.XX.XX.YYYYMMDD-XXX.img of=/dev/rdiskX bs=1m` (or [ApplePiBaker](http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/raspberry-pi/macosx-apple-pi-baker/))
   * <i>Windows</i>: Use [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
5. For HM-MOD-RPI-PCB use only: Make sure you have the HM-MOD-RPI-PCB radio module installed on the GPIO
6. Install microSD in your RaspberryPi and connect power
7. Wait until bootup process is finished and use a web browser to connect to http://homematic-raspi/

## Documentation
Documentation (e.g. how to port your HomeMatic configuration from a CCU2 to RaspberryMatic) and installation support is currently limited to using a mostly german language speaking fora with the following links pointing to the relevant sections of the fora where you can find documentation and help about RaspberryMatic:

* [RaspberryMatic - Installation Guide](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=34497#p328057)
* [RaspberryMatic - Forum](https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewforum.php?f=65)

## Contributions
As the RaspberryMatic project is an open source based project everyone is invited to contribute to this project. Please note, however, that functionality within the corresponding eQ-3 OCCU binaries can not be modified as the main HomeMatic services (rfd, ReGaHSS, HMServer, etc.) are provided in binary format by the [OCCU](https://github.com/eq-3/occu) project and not compiled from sources.

### Development
Building your own RaspberryMatic sd card image is a very straight forward process using this build environment â€“ given that you have sufficient Linux/Unix knowledge and you know what you are actually doing. But if you know what you are doing and which host tools are required to actually be able to run a RaspberryMatic build, it should be as simple as:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic
$ cd RaspberryMatic
$ make dist
[wait up to 1h]
$ make install of=/dev/sdX
```

### Using the generated cross compiler
After a successfull build of RaspberryMatic a dedicated cross compiler (`arm-linux-gcc`) should be available within the `build-raspberrypi3` path. You can use this GCC-based cross compiler to compile all kind of third party applications which can then be run within RaspberryMatic:

```
$ cd HelloWorld
$ <path-to-RaspberryMatic-build>/build-raspmatic_rpi3/host/usr/bin/arm-linux-gcc -o HelloWorld HelloWorld.c
```

A valid alternative for building RaspberryMatic ARM-hardfloat compatible binaries is to use the linaro based Linux cross compiler suite supplied [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian).
